# Starters

---

The Throwforward Vite plugin enables integration with endless tools and workflows. Here are a few starter templates to help you get going with Throwforward.

## Hono + HTMX

The Hono + HTMX starter template is a minimalistic setup that uses [Hono](https://hono.dev/) for server-side rendering and [HTMX](https://htmx.org/) for client-side interactions. This site is built using this setup.

## React

The React starter template is a bare-bones [Remix](https://remix.run) application.

```sh
mkdir my-app
cd my-app
npx degit jacob-ebey/throwforward/starters/remix
```

## Enhance SSR + HTMX

The HTMX starter template is a very minimalistic setup that uses [enhance-ssr](https://github.com/enhance-dev/enhance-ssr) for server-side rendering. It also enables client side routing with `hx-boost`.

```sh
mkdir my-app
cd my-app

```
