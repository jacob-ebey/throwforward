# Starters

The Throwforward Vite plugin enables integration with endless tools and workflows. Here are a few starter templates to help you get going with Throwforward.

## HTMX

The HTMX starter template is a very minimalistic setup that uses [enhance-ssr](https://github.com/enhance-dev/enhance-ssr) for server-side rendering. It also enables client side routing with `hx-boost`.

```sh
npx degit jacob-ebey/throwforward/starters/htmx
```

## React

The React starter template is a bare-bones [Remix](https://remix.run) application.

```sh
npx degit jacob-ebey/throwforward/starters/remix
```
